## Projects
### [DESIGN AND CONTROL OF AN ASSISTIVE EXOSKELETON KNEE MECHANISM](https://youtu.be/8KTMSBecCQ8)

Disabled and elderly individuals in Turkey have limited access to exoskeletons that will facilitate their movements. This negatively affects the lives of those individuals in Turkey. Aim of the project; to facilitate the access of individuals with these problems to exoskeletons that can help and to ease their daily lives.

In the project, intent determination is made with force sensors placed under the feet. The engine and spring system are used together to support the movement of the user, thus a more efficient system has been established.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yucelcanaksu/yucelcanaksu.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Projects
### [DESIGN AND CONTROL OF AN ASSISTIVE EXOSKELETON KNEE MECHANISM](https://youtu.be/8KTMSBecCQ8)

Disabled and elderly individuals in Turkey have limited access to exoskeletons that will facilitate their movements. This negatively affects the lives of those individuals in Turkey. Aim of the project; to facilitate the access of individuals with these problems to exoskeletons that can help and to ease their daily lives.

In the project, intent determination is made with force sensors placed under the feet. The engine and spring system are used together to support the movement of the user, thus a more efficient system has been established.

### [drone projesini eklicem buraya]()
This project was developed for TeknoFest's UAV competition. That years competition was picking up water from an pool and dropping it somewhere else. You can basically say firefighter drone. I worked on the image processing and the mechanism of water grab/release system.

Image processing was able to determine a water source and confirm its distance with LiDar. Water grab/release system was a basic mechanical system with a water sensor to stop water flow into the cup. Too much water was creating turbulance for the drone.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yucelcanaksu/yucelcanaksu.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
